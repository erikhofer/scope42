context: Basic technology stack is React with Ant Design. Which framework is
  used to create the app?
drivers: |-
  * Export feature should be able to produce static HTML.
  * Data is persisted on the local machine (:link{#decision-1}).
options:
  - title: NextJS
  - title: create-react-app
outcome:
  optionIndex: 1
  rationale: Because NextJS has problems with client-only apps (e.g. `router.push`
    requires page reload) and we do not need SSR aside from export.
  positiveConsequences: "* We do not have wo work around issues with NextJS."
  negativeConsequences: >-
    * For the export feature, we have to come up with another
    solution or go for a non-static approach.

    * If we want a landing page with proper SEO, we cannot integrate it with the app as easily.
