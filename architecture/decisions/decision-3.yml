context: How should the tool be distributed to users?
drivers: |-
  * Web technology for UI
  * UX
  * Delivering Updates
  * Access to local files (:link{#decision-1})
  * Code signing is not pratical
  * Possibility for export in CI/CD
options:
  - title: CLI with locally started web app
    description: similar to pgAdmin
  - title: Electron App
  - title: Pogressive Web App
    description: with File System Access API
    pros: |-
      * Proper UX, can be tried without any download.
      * Updates don't require actions by the user.
      * No code signing needed.
    cons: >-
      * File System Access API is not supported by all browsers yet, most
      notably Firefox. Chromium (Chrom/Edge) works.

      * Export feature will require a seperate tool that is distributed as CLI.
outcome:
  optionIndex: 2
  rationale: Because it is the most practical for now.
  positiveConsequences: ""
