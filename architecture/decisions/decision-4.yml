assesses: []
context: How should items be identified (references, file names).
drivers: |-
  * Human-readability and -sayability
  * Descriptivity
  * Writabality (e.g. for references in Markdown text fields)
  * URL patters and directory structure
options:
  - title: UUID
  - title: 2020-01-01-some-slug
  - title: "42"
  - title: issues/42
  - title: issue-42
  - title: ISSUE-42
  - title: issue#42
  - title: issue-0042
outcome:
  optionIndex: 4
  rationale: In conjunction with :link{#decision-5}.
  positiveConsequences: |-
    * Identifier is stable when title changes (no slug).
    * Item type is obvious from identifier in refernces (e.g. `cause: issue-2`).
    * (Virtually) infinite items (no leading zeros).
  negativeConsequences: |-
    * File name is not descriptive (no slug).
    * No differentiation between multiple projects (like in JIRA).
    * Files are not sorted properly (no leading zeros).
    * Long indentifiers for improvements.
    * Redundant information in path (e.g. `issues/issue-42`).
