      We asked the devlopment team on there opinion on this. Results:

      ```mermaid
      pie title Preference among developers
          "TypeScript" : 5
          "Flow" : 2
      ```
status: accepted
supersededBy: null
deciders:
  - Development Team
decided: null
assesses:
  - improvement-1
  - improvement-2
context: Because of :link{#issue-2} we have to reconsider :link{#decision-3}. In
  fact, it is now evident that we need static type cheking for the frontend. The
  decision now is which technology to use.

  - title: Flow
    description: :link{#improvement-2}
    pros: null
    cons: null
outcome:
  optionIndex: 0
  rationale: From an architecture standpoint, we do not have a strong opinion on
    this. Both options are suitable. Because of this, we go with the preference
    of the development team.
