context: Should we use static type checking for the frontend JavaScript code?
drivers: ""
options:
  - title: Use vanilla JavaScript
    description: null
    pros: |-
      * Easy setup
      * High development velocity for the MVP
    cons: "* May become hard to maintain later"
  - title: Use static type checking
    description: null
    pros: |-
      * Catch typing errors at build-time
      * More robust to refactoring
    cons: |-
      * Needs some extra setup work
      * Developers need to learn this on top of JavaScript
outcome:
  optionIndex: 0
  rationale: Based on the schedule for delivering the first prototype of the
    system and the fact that developers already need to learn JavaScript as a
    new language, we decide to go with vanilla JavaScript for now.
