  We have some scheduled task in the application that run regularly, e.g.
  clean-up tasks. I we deploy multiple instances of the application, the
  scheduled tasks would be executed on all of them and interfere with each
  other.

  In a cluster deployment, a mechanism is needed that ensures that each scheduled task is only executed on one node at a time.
